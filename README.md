## Presentation :

You play as a spirit named Goutie whose goal is to cross an ***[probably] enchanted cave***.

To help her in her quest, she will be able to use different **power orbs**: the ***Fire***, ***Ice*** and ***Poison*** orb. Each of these orbs gives her a specific power to continue progressing through the level.

But be careful, each power **orb brings its counterpart**. Make the best use of the available powers to reach the end of the level as quickly as possible.

**Find the power orbs** to **acquire new skills** and allow Goutie to overcome the obstacles to reach the end of the level.
